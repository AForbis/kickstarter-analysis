# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Following Louise's funding campaign for her play Fever, she wanted to better understand the relationship, if any, between a campaign's launch date and a campaign's funding goals. To help Louise understand these relationships I combed through the Kickstarter dataset and created two charts that visualize how a campaign's launch date and funding goals might affect a campaign's outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### To prepare for this visualization, I first created a new "Years" column in the dataset that would extract the year from the existing "Date Created Conversion" column. This would make sorting and analyzing the data easier within a pivot table and would produce a cleaner and more effective x-axis for the visualization. With the data ready, I then created the pivot table, being sure to break out the campaign outcomes by month for easier viewing. To make the visualization more applicable to Louise, I added filters for the parent category and years. I then filtered out all parent categories except for "theater" so the visualization was more applicable to Louise's experience. While I left the years filter untouched, including it would allow for year by year comparisons.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

## Recommendations
1. Theater has the most successful outcomes, followed by music, film and video, and technology, respectively.
2. Within Theater, plays are the most successful subcategory, followed by spaces, and musicals.
3. May and June were the most successful months to launch a play.
4. For US kickstarters...
